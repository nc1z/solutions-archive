## Why is 'this' and 'context' required?

### Example Without this or context

If you remove context and directly call func() without func.apply(this, args), any references to this within func will be undefined or may refer to the global context instead of the intended object.

```typescript
class User {
  name = "Alice";

  logName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }

  throttledLog = throttle(this.logName, 2000); // Using throttle on a method
}

const user = new User();
setInterval(user.throttledLog, 1000); // Expected: "Alice" every 2 seconds
```

In this setup:

- Without func.apply(this, args), this.name in logName will be undefined, resulting in an error or unexpected output, as this no longer refers to the User instance.

By preserving context, func.apply(context, args) ensures this.name correctly refers to User's name property.
